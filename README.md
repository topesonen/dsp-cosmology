Priors for the unknown properties of the Local Group from large cosmological simulations

The Local Group is the group of galaxies that contains the Milky Way, M31, and around 100 smaller galaxies. Some of its properties are known to great precision, but others, including the masses of the galaxies and the amount of intergalactic matter, the group's total energy and angular momentum, and its formation history, are difficult to measure directly. One way to infer or constrain these is to consider Local Group analogues from large cosmological simulations. In the project, the students will be provided access to data from a very large cosmological simulation (Illustris-TNG-300, https://www.tng-project.org/data/downloads/TNG300-1/), identify analogues of the Local Group, and can use their choice of statistical or machine-learning methods to derive conditional probability distributions for their properties, given different sets of observational constraints.
